# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Project purpose
Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, the data analyst oversamples the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersamples the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, the analyst usess a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Next, the analyst compares two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk and evaluates the performance of these models.
